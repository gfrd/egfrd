\section{Introduction}
This document gives an overview of functions that are usefull to end-users of the enhanced Green's Functions Reaction Dynamics (eGFRD) algorithm. In other words, it lists the "interface functions".
Basically, this entails a list of function definition plus their so-called python "docstrings", obtained straight from the code.
% Note that functions starting with an underscore are actually C++ functions ported to python by boost. 

\section{Functions}

\subsection{Functions from \texttt{model.py}}

\subsubsection{Core functions:}
As mentioned, all documentation in this document comes straight from the code. To obtain more information on how to structure a simple script, one could take a look into the sample directory.


The class you need to set up a particle model:
\begin{verbatim}
 class ParticleModel(_gfrd.Model):
    """
    """
    def __init__(self, world_size):
        """Create a new ParticleModel.

        Arguments:

                the size of one side of the simulation "world". Units: 
                meters.

        The simulation "world" is always assumed to be a cube with 
        *periodic boundary conditions*, with 1 corner at [0, 0, 0] and 
        the corner furthest away from [0, 0, 0] being at
        [world_size, world_size, world_size].

\begin{verbatim}
def Species(name, D, radius=0, structure="world", drift=0):
    """Define a new Species (in/on a specific Region or Surface).

    If a certain Species should be able to exist in the "world" as 
    well as in/on one of the previously created Regions or Surfaces, 
    then two distinct Species should be created. One with and one 
    without an explicit Structure argument.

\subsection{Functions from \texttt{gfrdbase.py}}

\subsubsection{Core functions}

\begin{verbatim}
def create_world(m, matrix_size=10):
    """Create a world object.
    
    The world object keeps track of the positions of the particles
    and the protective domains during an eGFRD simulation.

    Arguments:
        - m
            a ParticleModel previously created with model.ParticleModel.
        - matrix_size
            the number of cells in the MatrixSpace along the x, y and z 
            axis. Leave it to the default number if you don't know what 
            to put here.

    The simulation cube "world" is divided into (matrix_size x matrix_size 
    x matrix_size) cells. Together these cells form a MatrixSpace. The 
    MatrixSpace keeps track in which cell every particle and protective 
    domain is at a certain point in time. To find the neigherest 
    neighbours of particle, only objects in the same cell and the 26 
    (3x3x3 - 1) neighbouring cells (the simulation cube has periodic
    boundary conditions) have to be taken into account.

    The matrix_size limits the size of the protective domains. If you 
    have fewer particles, you want a smaller matrix_size, such that the 
    protective domains and thus the eGFRD timesteps can be larger. If 
    you have more particles, you want a larger matrix_size, such that 
    finding the neigherest neighbours is faster.
    
    Example. In samples/dimer/dimer.py a matrix_size of
    (N * 6) ** (1. / 3.) is used, where N is the average number of 
    particles in the world.

This file contains functions on common mathematical objects, transformations and formulas. Some of these functions are used throughout the algorithm, and some are supplied for convenience.

These functions do not contain docstrings, are sometimes self-explanatory and probably not needed that often in simulations. Therefore only definitions of functions that might be of interest to the user are listed here:

Mean arrival time:

def mean_arrival_time(r, D):
    return (r * r) / (6.0 * D)

Calculating with distances:

\subsection{Notes on other files}

\subsubsection{\texttt{bd.py}: Brownian Dynamic Simulator}
The class \texttt{BDSimulator} can be used in the same way as the EGFRDSimulator class, but performs Brownian Dynamics (BD) instead. Users who want to perform eGFRD simulations never need this. The simulator can be used for comparison of the eGFRD algorithm with Brownian Dynamics. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{gillespie.py}: Gillespie Simulator}
Similar to the BD simulator, the class \texttt{GillespieSimulatorBase} can be used for Gillespie type simulations. 

\subsubsection{\texttt{legacy.py}: Old redundant functions}
This module is called nowhere in the Python code. It contains an archive of outdated code.

\subsubsection{\texttt{multi.py}, \texttt{pair.py}, \texttt{single.py}}
These file contain the code that handle the specific events that happen in the different categories of domains.

\subsubsection{\texttt{myrandom.py}}
Contains a few convenient lines of code used when using random functions.
 
\subsubsection{\texttt{make\_cjy\_table.py.py}, \texttt{make\_sjy\_table.py.py}}
Generate (respectively cylindrical and spherical) bessel function tables.


\subsection{Function from module \texttt{logger.py}}

This module contains two loggers. One logger that logs in the hdf5 format, for obvious reasons in class \texttt{HDF5Logger}. Note that this logger requires the module h5py. The other logger gives output dictated more by the nature of the eGFRD algorithm.
The loggers are not (yet) explained in very much detail here, but both function in the same way. A logger class is made, which takes input on to which file to write, the logger can be started by \texttt{start()} and steps are logged by the function \texttt{log()}.

\subsubsection{HDF5 logger}

\begin{verbatim}
class HDF5Logger(object):
    def __init__(self, logname, directory='data', split=False):

    def log(self, sim, time):      

    def start(self, sim):
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{"Normal" logger}
\begin{verbatim}
class Logger(object):
    def __init__(self, logname='log', directory='data', comment=''):

    def log(self, sim, time):

    def start(self, sim):
\end{verbatim}
