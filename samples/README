Introduction
=====================================
When this README file was written, all Python code was checked for 
functionality. C++ files might still be in development (and thus non-
functional). Below one can find the contents of the samples directory,
sorted by function.

Contents
=====================================
See READMEs in sample folders for more information.

    Tutorial & Template
    =================================
    - template
    Contains template file to copy&paste some eGFRD code from. 
    - tutorial 
    Non-existent yet. ("TODO")
    - simple
    Instructive on how to use the logger.

    Examples
    =================================
    (alphabetical order)
    - cluster
    Measures unbinding/rebinding-time of molecule released from cluster.
    - irreversible
    Samples distance between two reagents placed next to each other, also 
    outputs reaction time.
    - mapk
    Script used for publication; Not looked into when this README file was
    written. ("TODO")
    - pushpull
    Pushpull example. Has no README file yet either. ("TODO")
    - rebind
    Measures reaction time and distances inbetween two molecules placed 
    right next to each other. Has option to add multiple particles of one
    reacting species, and option to add particles of non-reactive species.
    - reversible
    Does the same as rebind, but with two particles only.
    - single
    Defective example ("TODO"). 
    - tf
    ? ("TODO")
    

    Benchmarking
    =================================
    - benchmark
    Benchmarking utility that uses C++ part of code.
    - dimer
    Script that profiles the eGFRD algorithm. 
    - hardbody
    Runs a model composed of a single, non-reactive species. Outputs
    runtimes simulation runs.

    Testing
    =================================
    - bd_propagator
    Tests for the C++ version of the Brownian Dynamics simulator.

    - bd_test
    This folder will in the future hold scripts to test the Brownian
    Dynamics part of the code.
