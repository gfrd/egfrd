Introduction
=====================================
Script that "profiles" the eGFRD algorithm. This basically means a report
is generated on which part of the code uses the most resources. For more 
on profiling, see http://docs.python.org/library/profile.html#id1. 
The eGFRD algorithm is tested with a simple script which simulates the
reversible binding reaction between two species, S and P. 

This script is especially usefull for benchmarking and developers, but no
so much for end-users of the eGFRD algorithm.

Running
=====================================
$ PYTHONPATH=../../ python dimer.py 

Will already do the trick.
