This directory contains a sample PBS script (egfrd.qsub) to be used for starting
jobs on a TORQUE/Maui operated cluster with the "qsub" command and a bash script
(submit) which automatically submits series of jobs to the cluster (using "qsub").

To run a sample on the cluster, copy both scripts into the directory you want to
run the sample from and replace the start command in "egfrd.qsub".
To submit one job type

  ./submit 1 egfrd.qsub [error path]

[error path] is an optional argument specifying the output path for the default
and error output streams and is set to the directory you start "submit" from
by default.

Both scripts are commented and an example for a job start command is given
in "egfrd.qsub".
