Introduction
=====================================

This script also deals with the question of rebinding: when two particles can reversibly bind, what's the average time between an unbinding an binding event? (See also the "rebind" folder.)

The script contains the following reaction to simulate the rebinding:
A + B <-> C

With A and C having diffusion constant D = 0. 

To research the effect of clustering of biological receptors, this script
can place a "cluster" of A molecules in the simulation (i.e. it can
place densily packed A particles on a plane, within a circular area). 

In the center of the cluster a B particle is put. Then the simulation is allowed to run untill an unbinding and rebinding event have taken place.


Running
======================================

Run by:
$ python run.py [N] [runs] [outFilename] [Logmode, default=False]

Arguments:
  - N: Number of particles in cluster
  - runs: Number of simulation runs
  - outFilename: Name of output file
  - Logmode on/off: should be given False or True value. Is False by 
    default. If True, only 1 VTK-logged run is performed.    

E.g.:
$ python run.py 7 1000 data.out
Or:
$ python run.py 7 1 data.out True
